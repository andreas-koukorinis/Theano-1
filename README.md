# Theano
Python Theano Machine Learning Examples

The aim of these IPython notebooks is to show some features of the Python Theano library in the field 
of machine learning. It has been developped by the LISA group at the University of Montreal 
(see: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). The notebooks also rely on other standard Python 
libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

To exemplify the use of Theano, these notebooks solve the assignments of the Machine Learning MOOC 
provided by Coursera (see: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and performed in 
Stanford University by Andrew Ng (see: http://www.andrewng.org/).

The original MOOC assignments should to be programmed with the Octave language 
(see: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). The idea with these notebooks is to provide 
Python developpers with interesting examples programmed using Theano.

Content as of 04/04/2016:
1. theano linear regression
2. theano logistic regression
3. theano multi-class classification

These notebooks have been developped using the Anaconda Python 3.4 distribution provided by 
Continuum Analytics (see: https://www.continuum.io/). They require the Jupyter Notebook 
(see: http://jupyter.org/).
